This software is licensed under the [Polyform Shield License 1.0.0](https://polyformproject.org/licenses/shield/1.0.0/),
subject to the following Redistribution & Integrity Grant:

1. Permitted Commercial Redistribution
   Notwithstanding any restrictive language in the base license,
   users are granted a non-exclusive, royalty-free right to
   redistribute the unmodified mConfig library (in source or binary form)
   as an integrated component of a larger commercial product or service.

2. Design Integrity Restriction (The "No-Forks" Clause)
   To prevent architectural fragmentation and ensure the consistency of
   the tiered Scope and Config Scheme standards during this development phase:

   The right to distribute modified versions (derivatives or "forks")
   of the mConfig Core is strictly withheld until version 1.0.0.
   Users may modify the code for private, internal use/bug-fixing,
   but such modifications may not be redistributed publicly
   or as part of a competing library.

3. Transition to Open Source
   The Licensor commits to re-licensing the mConfig Core module under the
   Apache License upon the official release of version 1.0.0.
   This rider serves as a temporary safeguard for the library's
   architectural foundation during its maturation.
